# ThesisCode
Code for the Bachelor Thesis Project on Serial Dependence.

Data unavailable for request (as I am not the owner).
Scripts can only run if you have the raw dataset that belongs to this project.

Make sure all files and the raw dataset are in the same folder.
Filenames starting with H1_ are part of the main analysis.
Filenames starting with EX_ are part of the exploratory analysis.

Run PERMUTATION_TEST.m before running H1_SD_COMBINED to create the necessary amp.diffs variable. 

Run all EX_SEPERATE() codes before running EX_LINEAR_MODELS.m to create the necessary amplitudes for linear analysis.

Enjoy!
